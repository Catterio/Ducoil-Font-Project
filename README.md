# Ducoil Font Project

Ducoil is a comtemporary pixel font family, with dimensions 10px in height and (for monospaced style, not accounting side-bearings) 10px in width. Developed by Catterio, the font project is created using FontStruct.com as the backbone with the help of FontLab 8 for fixing bugs in the font softwares.
