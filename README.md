# Ducoil Font Project


Ducoil is a contemporary pixel font family, with dimensions 14×8px. Developed by Catterio, the font project is created using [FontStruct](https://fontstruct.com) as the backbone with the help of FontLab 8 for fixing bugs in the font softwares.

The font covers Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts, supporting 105<nbsp>**^** languages in total (as provided by [FontDrop](https://fontdrop.com):<br>
Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chechen, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Greek, Afrikaans, Albanian, Asu, Basque, Bemba, Bena, Breton, Catalan, Chiga, Colognian, Cornish, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Embu, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Filipino, Finnish, French, Friulian, Galician, Ganda, German, Gusii, Hungarian, Icelandic, Inari, Sami, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Jola-Fonyi, Kabuverdianu, Kalenjin, Kamba, Kikuyu, Kinyarwanda, Latvian, Lithuanian, Lower, Sorbian, Luo, Luxembourgish, Luyia, Machame, Makhuwa-Meetto, Makonde, Malagasy, Maltese, Manx, Meru, Morisyen, Northern, Sami, North, Ndebele, Norwegian, Bokmål, Norwegian, Nynorsk, Nyankole, Oromo, Polish, Portuguese, Quechua, Romanian, Romansh, Rombo, Rundi, Rwa, Samburu, Sango, Sangu, Scottish, Gaelic, Sena, Serbian, Shambala, Shona, Slovak, Slovenian, Soga, Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Swiss, German, Taita, Teso, Turkish, Upper, Sorbian, Uzbek (Latin), Vietnamese, Volapük, Vunjo, Walser, Welsh, Western, Frisian, Zulu.
